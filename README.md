Agricultural pest detection plays a crucial role in ensuring the health and productivity of crops. The use of advanced computer vision techniques has shown great potential in automating the process of pest detection in agriculture. This project proposes the use of Enhanced YOLOv5, a state-of-the-art object detection model, to accurately identify and classify pests in agricultural settings. The existing pest detection systems often suffer from limitations such as low detection accuracy, inability to identify specific types of pests, and high false alarm rates. These drawbacks result in ineffective pest management and can lead to significant crop damage and economic losses for farmers. By leveraging the capabilities of Enhanced YOLOv5, this proposed system aims to address these shortcomings by providing a more robust and precise method for detecting and classifying agricultural pests. The model's enhanced performance in object detection and classification will enable it to accurately identify and differentiate between various pest species, allowing for targeted pest control measures to be implemented. The proposed system offers several advantages over existing methods, including higher accuracy in pest detection, reduced false alarm rates, and the ability to identify specific pest species and their respective defects in crops. Moreover, the automation of pest detection using Enhanced YOLOv5 will contribute to increased efficiency and cost-effectiveness in agricultural pest management.
